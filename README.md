# Ecoblobs
  This is a project I have been working on during the summer and in my free time. The idea of the project is to create a simulation of a life-like ecosystem of critters, however due to my limited graphical skills animals and plants are represented by blobs.

### Current Features
  * GUI that allows the user to tweak some simple variables and see the relative total masses of movers and plants
  * Plants that grow at a constant rate and respawn when eaten
  * Blobs that eat smaller blobs, avoid bigger blobs, eat plants, and divide.

### Plans
  * Sexual reproduction
  * Plant reproduction
  * Genetics
  * Speciation
  * Realitic balancing (Ecosystems that resemble real ones)
  * **Javascript Version???**
