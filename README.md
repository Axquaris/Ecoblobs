# Ecoblobs
  This is a project I have been working on during the summer and in my free time. The idea of the project is to create a simulation of a life-like ecosystem of critters, however due to my limited graphical skills animals and plants are represented by blobs.

### Current Features
  * GUI that allows the user to tweak some simple variables and see the relative total masses of movers and plants
  * Plants that grow at a constant rate and respawn when eaten
  * Blobs that eat smaller blobs, avoid bigger blobs, eat plants, and divide.

### Plans
  * Sexual reproduction
  * Plant reproduction
  * Genetics
  * Speciation
  * Realitic balancing (Ecosystems that resemble real ones)
  * **Javascript Version???**

### If you want to help
  Download Processing 2 and add the guido library through Sketch > Import Library > Add Library... 
  Processing is based off of java and is a bit like a library/IDE that makes doing graphics much easier.
  You could try using the latest Processing 3 but I am not sure if guido works with it.
  
  You can contact me at domceb@gmail.com if you wish to discuss more.
